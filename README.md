# Quantum Dino â€” Amplitude Amplification Action Based Selection
Playing the "No Internet Google Chrome Dinosaur Game" with a quantum computer!

In video games, we constantly pick moves we need to perform from a given moveset. Maybe, it's something like ["move up", "move down", "move left" , "move right", "punch", "kick"]. When we play video games, we choose what inputs we want to send through the controller based on certain key parameters in a video game at a given frame. Maybe if an enemy is too close, we want to select the "kick" move, or if the objective is to the far right of the screen, perhaps the "move right" move is the most beneficial. In classical computing, we can determine which move to select from the moveset using an else-if chain, which will find the optimal move in linear time. Finding an item from a list is nothing but a search algorithm! It turns out that we can upgrade the search speed quadratically for selecting an item in a list using Grover's Algorithm!

Therefore, in this project, I develop a way to play Google's "No Internet Dino Game", using a modified parameterized Grover's Algorithm. I use Amplitude Amplification Action Based Selection to select the optimal move from a moveset at a given frame of the video game.
